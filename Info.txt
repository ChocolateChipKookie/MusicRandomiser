The *.exe file is an application that will add tags to all the *.mp3 files in the directory it is placed in, so they get shuffled.

There cannot be another *.exe file in the same directory.
The application has to be called "shuffle.exe" or "unshuffle.exe" depending on what you want the application to do.

If it is called "shuffle.exe", it will either add tags to untagged music files or reshuffle the already tagged files.

If it is called "unshuffle.exe", it will remove the tags on all the tagged music files.
